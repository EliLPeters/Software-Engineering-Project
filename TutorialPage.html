						The object of the game is to complete as many questions correctly as possible.
						To do this, simply read each question, then click on the button beneath which
						contains the most reasonable answer.<br>
						<br>
						Scoring will be measured as a ratio of questions answered correctly out of the
						number of questions asked entirely for each phase. A percentage showing the
						current overall progress through the current quiz phase will also be displayed.<br>
						<br>
						If you get a question wrong, don't fret; you'll have the chance to learn from
						your mistakes and answer it correctly next time.<br>
						<br>
						You can log out at any time using the button at the bottom of the interface,
						but be warned that your progress for the current phase will not be saved if you
						log out before completing it.<br>
