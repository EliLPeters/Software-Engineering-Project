					The object of the game is to complete as many questions correctly as possible.<br>
					To do this, simply read each question, then click on the button beneath which<br>
					contains the most reasonable answer.<br>
					<br>
					Scoring will be measured as a ratio of questions answered correctly out of the<br>
					number of questions asked entirely for each phase. A percentage showing the<br>
					current overall progress through the current quiz phase will also be displayed.<br>
					<br>
					If you get a question wrong, don't fret; you'll have the chance to learn from<br>
					your mistakes and answer it correctly next time.<br>
					<br>
					You can log out at any time using the button at the bottom of the interface,<br>
					but be warned that your progress for the current phase will not be saved if you<br>
					log out before completing it.<br>
